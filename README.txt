This is an alternative addon system for Star Wars Battlefront II (2005)

It is meant to be a 'Drop and Click' process (after initial setup).


Initial setup:
1. Backup your .lvl files at '_LVL_XBOX\'  (or '_LVL_PS2\', '_lvl_psp\')
   * Create a folder in your StarWarsBattlefront2 folder called "lvl_backup" (the name doesn't really matter, just a place to copy your files to so that you can find them later if you wish to restore the original functionality of the game.)
   * Copy [mission.lvl, shell.lvl] to this folder
2. Copy the 'shell.lvl' from the 'addon' folder to the "_LVL_XBOX\" folder
   * This is a slightly modified 'shell.lvl' file that will look through the 'addon' folder
     adding the mods.


Adding a mod:
1. Drop the mod in the addon folder (a folder from '000' - '999' )
2. Double-Click the 'MissionMerge.exe' program (in the addon folder )
   * This will process through the mod folders and create a 'mission.lvl' file that includes the stuff inside 'base.mission.lvl' and the missions from the mods mission.lvl files (this will be placed at the same level as the 'addon' folder, deploy this too).
3. Deploy to device (if necessary)
